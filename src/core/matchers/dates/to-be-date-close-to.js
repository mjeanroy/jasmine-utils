 * Check that the tested date object and an actual date object are close.
 *
 * By default, the difference in milliseconds between both dates must not exceed 1000ms,
 * but the last parameter may be set to increase/decrease this value.
 *
 * The tested date and the date to compare may be:
 * - A date instance.
 * - A timestamp.
 * - A string that can be parsed with the `Date` constructor (i.e `new Date('2016-01-01')`).
 *
 * **Note:** Using date strings should be avoided due to browser differences and inconsistencies.
 *
 * @message Expect date [actual] (not) to be close to [date]
 * @example
 *   expect(new Date(1995, 1, 1, 10, 0, 0, 0)).toBeDateCloseTo(new Date(1995, 1, 1, 10, 0, 0, 500));

 *
 * @param {Object} ctx Test context.
 * @param {Date|number|string} date The second date to compare with.
 * @param {number} max The maximum difference in milliseconds between both dates, default to 1000.
 * @return {Object} The test result.
