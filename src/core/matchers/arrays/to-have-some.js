/**
 * Verifies that the tested object satisfies a predicate function for at
 * at least one element in the collection.
 *
 * The collection may be an `array`, a `set`, a `map` or any iterable object.
 *
 * The predicate function is executed with three arguments:
 * - The value being iterated.
 * - The key of the value being iterated.
 * - The collection being iterated.
 *
 * **Important:**
 * Note that the key may be different with arrays and map/set:
 * - With an array or an iterable object, the key will be the index of the value being traversed.
 * - With a map, the key will be the index value of the value being traversed.
 * - With a set, the key will be the same value being traversed (since a `Set` does not have any keys).
 *
 * See the documentation of the `forEach` functions of `Map` and `Set` structure:
 * - https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Objets_globaux/Set/forEach
 * - https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Objets_globaux/Map
 *
 * This matcher may take an optional first argument: the error message that will
 * be displayed if the matcher does not pass.
 *
 * @message
 *   Expect [actual] (not) to have at least one element that verify condition
 *   Expect [actual] (not) to have at least one element that verify "[message]"
 *
 * @example
 *   expect([1, 2, 3]).toHaveSome(x => x % 2 === 0);
 *   expect([1, 3, 5, 7]).not.toHaveSome(x => x % 2 === 0);
 *
 * @param {Object} ctx Test context.
 * @param {string} msg Custom error message (optional).
 * @param {function} iterator Predicate function.
 * @return {Object} Test result.
